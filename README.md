# Basket â€” Donation Payments

Donation payments iOS app that allows users to make streamlined donations towards a cause, rather than specific nonprofits.
Each cause (e.g. LGQBT+, racial equality, education, etc.) is associated with a predetermined "Basket" of nonprofits, and donations towards the cause are automatically split evenly among the nonprofits.

### My Inspiration
Recently, in the height of the [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/) movement, I found a particular painpoint I encountered was the difficulty in discovering and donating to multiple nonprofits that worked towards racial justice.
The problem is that lots of important causes and nonprofits are doing good work, but oftentimes donations aren't distributed evenly among them. This leads to some nonprofits (like the Minnesota Freedom Fund) receiving way more money than they can reasonably handle. Also makes donating towards a cause much simpler for the consumer :)
