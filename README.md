# Basket â€” Donation Payments

Donation payments iOS app that allows users to make donations towards a cause, rather than specific nonprofits.
Each cause (e.g. LGQBT+, racial equality, education, etc.) is associated with a predetermined "Basket" of nonprofits, and donations towards the cause are automatically split evenly among the nonprofits. User has choice of reassigning split percentages.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Finance + Productivity + Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Quick, one-touch donations. More convenient and phone-friendly than a website. Easy to use from social media link.
- **Story:** Lots of important causes and nonprofits that are doing good work, but oftentimes donations aren't distributed evenly among them. This leads to nonprofits (like the Minnesota Freedom Fund) receiving way too high of a volume of incoming donations than they can reasonably handle. Also makes donating towards a cause much simpler for the consumer :) Also easy to discover new nonprofits doing work in the field!
- **Market:** Activists, people who care about a cause. Anyone looking to donate towards a cause/mission. Anyone looking to discover new nonprofits.
- **Habit:** Becomes the go-to donation app instead of donating on 2384 different websites; streamlined platform.
- **Scope:** Essentially money splitter + payments API, at its core. Lots of potential features to expand on (better payments, social, adding nonprofits as users), but MVP is also worthwhile.
